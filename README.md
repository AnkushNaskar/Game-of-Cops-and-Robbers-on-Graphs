# Game-of-Cops-and-Robbers-on-Graphs

CS201 Course Project

We have implemented the classic game of Cops and Robbers on simple grids, cylinders, and torus type (sphere like) graph. To make edits to the code, ensure you have Visual Studio and SFML library installed on your system, or just run the Code.exe file in the Game-of-Cops-and-Robbers-on-Graphs/Compiled/ folder to play the game!

To interact with the graphs, click on the nodes to establish initial positions for both cops and the robber. You can then control the movement of the robber using the arrow keys, or keep the robber stationary by pressing any other key. <br><br>
The yellow nodes represent the cops, while the red node designates the position of the robber.
