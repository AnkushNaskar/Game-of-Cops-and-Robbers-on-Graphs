# Game-of-Cops-and-Robbers-on-Graphs

CS201 Course Project

We have included the codes of simple grid, cylinder and tori type graphs, which use SFML library of C++ for visuals. We need Visual Studio and SFML installed for it.
Click on the graph nodes to set the initial positions of the cops and the robber. Use the arrow keys to control the robber on the graph, and press any other key to keep the robber stationary. Yellow nodes indicate cops and the Red node indicates the robber.
